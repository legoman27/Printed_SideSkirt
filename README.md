# Printed_Sidepack
A fully printed mod intended for a Voron Trident to relocate the electronics to the side of the printer\

Heavily inspired by by `kyledavis417#2007`'s Trident sidepack mod

Huge thanks to the Voron design team for everything!

Uses a completely stock Voron Spec Trident frame. Verticals are all the same length for 250 / 300 / 350, so the front and rear pieces will be the same for all sizes. 

Current design assumes a total thickness of side panel + foam tape = 3mm
