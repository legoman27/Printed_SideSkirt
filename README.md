# Printed_Sidepack
A fully printed mod intended for a Voron Trident to relocate the electronics to the side of the printer

Heavily inspired by by `kyledavis417#2007`'s Trident sidepack mod

Huge thanks to the Voron design team for everything!



Current design assumes a total thickness of side panel + foam tape = 3mm

This mod could also be mounted on the rear of a printer, but this prevents access to the A/B belts at the rear of the gantry.

Uses a completely stock Voron Spec Trident frame. Verticals are all the same length for 250 / 300 / 350, so the front and rear pieces will be the same for all sizes. 
LDO frames are taller, and will require different designs.

Total width of the skirts is 88mm.

# Future Plans

- [ ] add support for 300 & 350 frames
- [ ] add support for LDO frames
- [ ] add some sort of display capability in the side skirt, mabye a btt TFT43 if it is at all possible to rotate the display by 90 degrees.
